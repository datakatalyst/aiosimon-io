# Makefile for building and testing the aiosimon_io package
# This Makefile is used to automate the process of building, testing,
# and checking the code quality of the aiosimon_io package.
# It provides targets for running tests, checking code style, building
# the package, generating documentation, and uploading the package to PyPI.
# It also includes a target for cleaning up build artifacts.
# The Makefile uses Sphinx for generating documentation and pytest for
# running tests. It also uses flake8, black, isort, and mypy for checking
# code quality. The Makefile is designed to be run from the command line
# and can be customized by setting environment variables or command line
# arguments.
